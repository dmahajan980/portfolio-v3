Started embracing AI-based tooling for my work, specifically
[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). Initially I was
skeptical, mainly due to all of the twitter hubbub around when and where it
fails miserably. Those flubs appear to be a result of over ambitious
expectations, I believe. These tools work best when you let them exist in the
background, relying on them only as a helpful nudge here and there when you're
stuck. Plus the auto-complete suggestions are a great productivity boost.
