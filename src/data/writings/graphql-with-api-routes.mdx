In a typical Next.js app, you'll likely fetch page data server-side using either
`getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`. However, what if you need to fetch
data client-side? You might not need every piece of data to be server-side
rendered or statically generated, so this is a reasonable question to ask.
Moreover, if you use a GraphQL client like Apollo or Urql, data fetching hooks
such as `useQuery(){:ts}` will attempt to fetch data client-side by default
whenever their cache for a query is empty or stale. In this post, we'll walk
through a realistic data fetching scenario using a third-party GraphQL endpoint
in a Next.js app and how to fetch data client-side while keeping private API
keys hidden from the client.

1. You have a Next.js app that uses a third-party GraphQL endpoint.
2. You want to fetch this data client-side.
3. You need to access this data using a private API key and don't want to expose
   it to the client.

## Step 1: Configure your GraphQL client

For this example, we'll use GitHub's GraphQL API and graphql-request, but you
could use any method you prefer. Here's how we create a GraphQL client with the
necessary information to make our request to GitHub:

```ts
// graphql/client.ts

export const createGithubClient = () => {
  return new GraphQLClient('https://api.github.com/graphql', {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN}`,
    },
  });
};
```

We pass in an Authorization header referencing our GITHUB_TOKEN environment
variable, which will only be available on the server and not the client. It's
best practice to keep API keys and secrets obscured from the client, and
environment variables are an effective way to do so.

## Step 2: Create our API route

Next, we create a Next.js API route to handle all requests to the GitHub GraphQL
API from the client. Here's the code:

```ts
// pages/api/github.ts

import { createGithubClient } from '@/graphql/client';
import { Variables } from 'graphql-request';
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

const handler = async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  // Verify that the request method is POST
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    res.status(405).end();
    return;
  }

  // Extract the query and variables from the request body
  const { query, variables } = req.body as {
    query: string;
    variables?: Variables;
  };

  try {
    // Initialize our GraphQL client
    const client = createGithubClient();

    // Make the request to GitHub's GraphQL API using our client
    const data = await client.request(query, variables);

    // Send the response data back to the client
    res.status(200).send(data);
  } catch (error) {
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
    console.error('error:', error);
    res.status(200).send('Server Error');
  }
};

export default handler;
```

With this code, any requests to /api/github will be handled by this API route.

## Step 3: Fetch data client-side

We'll use [Urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) for this example but
you could use Apollo or any other data fetching method. Here's how we set up the
client in our `_app.tsx` file:

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx

import { createClient, Provider } from 'urql';

const client = createClient({
  // The url of our API route
  url: '/api/github',
});

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) => {
  return (
    <Provider value={client}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Provider>
  );
};
```

Now we can use the `useQuery` hook to fetch data client-side. Here's an example
of in our `index.tsx` file:

```tsx
// pages/index.tsx

import { useQuery } from 'urql';

const query = `
  query { 
    user(login: "h-jennings") {
      name
      bio
    }
  }
`;

const Home = () => {
  const [{ fetching, error, data }] = useQuery({ query });

  if (fetching) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Oh no... {result.error.message}</div>;
  }

  const { user } = data;
  const { name, bio } = user;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <p>{bio}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

## Conclusion

This is a very simple example of how you can fetch data client-side with Next.js
using a third-party GraphQL endpoint and an api route. I hope this helps you get
started with your own projects. If you have any questions or comments, feel free
