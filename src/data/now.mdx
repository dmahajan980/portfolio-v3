- Launched a Quiz for Audible's marketing team.
- Building and launching Audible's new Brand Guide website very soon.
- Excited to try out [React Server Components with Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/react-18/server-components). This should be a fantastic pairing of technologies.
- Our team at [Elegant Seagulls](https://www.elegantseagulls.com/) is interested in adopting some new technologies for future projects. The new Audible Brand site was the testing ground for them.
  - [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) - CSS-in-JS theming and styling
  - [Urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) - GraphQL client
- I'm still very interested in exploring Shopify's new meta framework for React: [Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/). Hopefully with React 18 recently going into Release Candidate, things will start to move fast in this space.
