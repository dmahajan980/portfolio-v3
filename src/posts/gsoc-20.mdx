> GSoC is for competent programmers; beginners have got nothing to do with it!

There’s a lot of people having this misconception about Google Summer of Code. Even you
might be of this opinion before coming here. Allow me to take you out of this delusion by
sharing my experience thus far!

# Introduction

My name is Divyanshu Mahajan, and I am an undergraduate student at BITS Pilani. I’ve been
into programming for more than a year now, majorly working on web and JavaScript based
projects.

My open-source journey has been a roller coaster ride, but all the efforts and hardships
landed me to **Google Summer of Code 2020**. I have worked with the **Inclusive Design
Institute** this summer.

# Getting Introduced to GSoC

It was May of 2019 when my batchmates were preparing for college exams. Scrolling through
my social media, I saw this post by one of my seniors.

I was unaware of GSoC and open-source those days, so I talked directly to this senior. He
told me everything about it, how it works, and the perks that the program has to offer. At
first, it seemed a bit complicated and challenging, but I remember him saying

> You'll have one of the best summers of your life if you get selected!

I don’t know what it was back then, but clicked me inside and I made up my mind to give it
a shot next year!

I started exploring more details about the program. From what their website says and what
I understood, GSoC is a global program focused on bringing developers into open-source
software development. The shortlisted candidates are paired with a mentor from the
participating organizations to work on a project. This helps in gaining exposure to
real-world software development and learn new techniques while earning a stipend.

For more details, check out their
[website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works).

# Finding Organizations and Projects

I started looking for previous year organizations in mid-December and shortlisted a couple
of organizations/projects. One of them was [InterMine](http://intermine.org/), a team from
the Department of Genetics at University of Cambridge. Folks in that community were very
kind and supportive and some of their projects seemed very interesting.

The process after finding an organization looked roughly as mentioned below:

1. Join the organization’s communication channel (Slack, IRC, Gitter, et cetera).
2. Go through their project idea’s description in the ideas list, if available. Otherwise,
   talk to their community members and mentors about the project.
3. Look through the project’s open issues and pick one basic/beginner-friendly issue to
   get started with the codebase. Try to get the issue assigned to you first before you
   start working on it.
4. Once you solve an issue, send a pull request (PR) as per the organization’s standards
   and practices.
5. As you get familiar with the codebase, move on to solving more difficult issues.

I followed these steps and started working on the project. After spending some time and
solving the issue I was assigned, I created my first PR to the codebase. My confidence
boosted when the PR got merged, and I jumped onto solving other issues.

I was quite an active member and ended up making a decent number of contributions. The
whole community was fun to interact and work with. A big shoutout to
[Yo Yehudi](https://twitter.com/yoyehudi) (GSoC Org Admin, InterMine) for being so
helpful, patient, friendly, and supportive.

# Announcement of Selected Organizations

The GSoC team selects and publishes the list of selected organizations quite some time
before students submit their proposals.

As the results came in, one of the InterMine mentors announced that they were not
shortlisted. I was disappointed as I was hoping to participate and apply for InterMine.

It was a tough call to search and apply for a new organization since I had my college
exams in between. And it left me barely enough time to understand and contribute to the
project and prepare a good proposal. I reached out to a few seniors who participated in
GSoC in the past. After describing the whole situation, they encouraged me to spend time
finding another organization and applying for it.

## Inclusive Design Institute: An Exciting Project

After my exams, I started searching for another organization and came across
**Inclusive Design Institute.** Their project ideas were targeted towards increasing web
accessibility and inclusiveness. One of the projects
[“Using a Game Controller as a Navigation Aid”](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project#GoogleSummerofCode2020withtheFluidProject-UsingaGameControllerasaNavigationAid)
seemed very innovative and exciting at a glance. It sounded really cool to build this
browser compatibility layer for controllers that won't require mouse or keyboard for
navigation.

I got in touch with my mentor ([Tony Atkins](https://twitter.com/duhrer)), asked questions
related to the project, and tried to get an idea about his vision for this project. For
checking the project's implementation feasibility and my understanding about the idea, I
built a demonstrative prototype. I shared that with him, and he liked the
abstraction.

With the feedback I received on the prototype, and the research I did, I
started working on my proposal. The initial draft took 8–9 days and was ready to be shared
with my mentor. After receiving some feedback from him and making a few final changes, I
submitted my proposal on the last
date.

# D-Day

The student projects were to be announced on May 4, 2020. I was obnoxiously waiting for
the results and had been checking up the time frequently. Soon it was 11:30 pm, and I
received a call from my friend. As soon as I picked up the call, he said,
_“Phoda Bhai! Congratulations”_. I immediately opened up my GSoC dashboard, and my eyes
were filled with tears when I saw the results on GSoC dashboard:

It took me some time to digest this news, but my happiness level was on Cloud Nine. Later,
I received my acceptance mail.

I am grateful to my mentor **Tony Atkins** and the Fluid Community for considering me to
work on this project.

I think it’s worth mentioning here that even if it feels that the situation isn’t in your
favor, keep trying. You never know what’s going to happen. Even if you lose, you’ll learn
something out of it.

# Post selection

Getting selected for GSoC is not the end. It is where the real stuff begins.

My project was [Gamepad Navigator](https://github.com/fluid-lab/gamepad-navigator), a
Chrome extension that allows the user to navigate web sites and browsers using a game
controller. Traditionally, browsers are controlled using a mouse, keyboard, or touch
input. Gamepads are popular devices, and a lot of work has been done to extend their
usefulness to a wide variety of people, such as one-handed controllers, which are designed
for people with limited mobility or amputees. So the basic idea was to benefit from the
work done to make gamepads more accessible and make browser navigation more inclusive.

It was a completely new project and thus turned out to be a great learning experience for
me. I learned a lot of amazing stuff from my mentor **Tony**, and it was thrilling to see
the project coming together as we worked. There was a lot more into those three months
than just coding. I worked my way through writing the complete documentation, preparing a
presentation, a demonstration video (more on that later), and presenting my work to the
community members. To sum up, it was a fantastic and productive summer altogether!

To know more about my work during the summer and the final product, check out my
[work log](https://dmahajan980.github.io/gsoc20WorkLog/) and the
[work product report](https://gist.github.com/dmahajan980/865d137e486c21f02f3335ac34f9c2b0).
You can also see the
[demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmryYYO4qvc) that I prepared for
demonstrating the whole project.

I’m in the final phase of the journey and trying to complete the remaining stuff before the final evaluation. The program would be ending in a few days, and I have already started to miss the check-ins and long discussions with my mentor, but part of the journey is the end. Even though the program ends, my contributions won’t stop. I’ll keep working and adding more features in the extension for everyone to use.

_At last, I’d like to thank you for reading the article :)_

_If you have any doubts or want to check my proposal, feel free to ask in the comments._
